 Fade

 This example shows how to fade an LED on pin 9
 using the analogWrite() function.

 The analogWrite() function uses PWM, so if
 you want to change the pin you're using, be
 sure to use another PWM capable pin. On most
 Arduino, the PWM pins are identified with 
 a "~" sign, like ~3, ~5, ~6, ~9, ~10 and ~11.

 This example code is in the public domain.

int fadeAmount = 5;    // how many points to fade the LED by

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // declare pin 9 to be an output:
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  // set the brightness of pin 9:

  brightness = brightness + fadeAmount;

# HW 1 - Optional 2 LED
#### May 24, 2017 - Optional: Can you figure out how to connect two LEDs to your Arduino and how to make them blink?


```Javascript
/*
  Blink
  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO 
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino model, check
  the Technical Specs of your board  at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products
  
  This example code is in the public domain.

  pinMode(11, OUTPUT); // Initialize PinMode

}

# HW 2 -  [Analog Input tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/AnalogInput)
#### May 26, 2017 - Read and do the Arduino AnalogInput tutorial. Use your LDR and not a potentiometer. Make notes in your "journal" (your README.md file) of any interesting things you discover or any problems that you run into.

##### Encountered Problem
Using the code from the website only gave me the value "0" when I added a print.ln and created a serial port. Trying another program from the example given by arduino, I was able to make it work. But why is the code that was given from the website not working? (code below) I attached an extra LED light to the existing built in LED pin 13 and when I cover the LDR the blinking goes faster? How does this work?

```Javascript
/*
  Analog Input
 Demonstrates analog input by reading an analog sensor on analog pin 0 and
 turning on and off a light emitting diode(LED)  connected to digital pin 13.
 The amount of time the LED will be on and off depends on
 the value obtained by analogRead().

 The circuit:
 * Potentiometer attached to analog input 0
 * center pin of the potentiometer to the analog pin
 * one side pin (either one) to ground
 * the other side pin to +5V
 * LED anode (long leg) attached to digital output 13
 * LED cathode (short leg) attached to ground

 * Note: because most Arduinos have a built-in LED attached
 to pin 13 on the board, the LED is optional.

 */

int sensorPin = A0;    // select the input pin for the potentiometer
int ledPin = 13;      // select the pin for the LED
int sensorValue = 0;  // variable to store the value coming from the sensor

void setup() {
  // declare the ledPin as an OUTPUT:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // read the value from the sensor:
  sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);
  // turn the ledPin on
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  // stop the program for <sensorValue> milliseconds:
  delay(sensorValue);
  // turn the ledPin off:
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  // stop the program for for <sensorValue> milliseconds:
  delay(sensorValue);
}
```

##### Fix to problem above
I placed sensorValue onto [Serial.println(sensorValue);] and I was able to come up with the desired values.(code below)

##### Resource used for this week's assignment
+ http://www.instructables.com/id/Auotmatic-Street-lights-control-using-LDR-and-Ardu/
+ https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ifStatementConditional

##### Encountered Problem
I was able to make the built in LED work however when I added an external LED it was behaving differently from my conditionals that I placed. 

##### Problem Solve
Make sure the 13 pin goes into ground instead of connecting it to 5V. When this connection is made from 13 Pin > 5V instead of Ground, you will create the opposite effect of the conditional making the external LED light up when it's suppose to be low then off when it's suppose to be high.

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board

  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  //pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(6, OUTPUT );

  //digitalWrite(6, HIGH);
  analogWrite(6, 230);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(2, LOW);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(4, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second

  digitalWrite(2, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(4, HIGH);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
