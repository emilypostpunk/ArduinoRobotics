# HW 1 - how to use a sensor
#### May 24, 2017
```Javascript
/*
  AnalogReadSerial
  Reads an analog input on pin 0, prints the result to the serial monitor.
  Graphical representation is available using serial plotter (Tools > Serial Plotter menu)
  Attach the center pin of a potentiometer to pin A0, and the outside pins to +5V and ground.

  This example code is in the public domain.
*/

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  // read the input on analog pin 0:
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
  // print out the value you read:
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  delay(1);        // delay in between reads for stability
}
```

# HW 1 - Optional 2 LED
#### May 24, 2017 - Optional: Can you figure out how to connect two LEDs to your Arduino and how to make them blink?


```Javascript
/*
  Blink
  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO 
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino model, check
  the Technical Specs of your board  at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products
  
  This example code is in the public domain.

  pinMode(11, OUTPUT); // Initialize PinMode
  pinMode(10, OUTPUT); //Don't forget to put pinMode or else it will be very dim lighting.
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever. Change this to alter the blinking patterns.

  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
