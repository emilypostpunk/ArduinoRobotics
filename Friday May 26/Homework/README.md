### current homework assignment

#### Homework due Friday May 26

+ Read the soldering tutorial [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#soldering)
+ Read all the motor tutorials [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#motors)
+ Read and do the Arduino [AnalogInput tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/AnalogInput). Use your LDR and not a potentiometer. Make notes in your "journal" (your README.md file) of any interesting things you discover or any problems that you run into.
+ Modify the program so that it also prints the values of sensorValue. I showed you this in class. You might also refer to the println tutorial. Make note of the approximate range of values you get, between covering up the the light sensor (dark) and uncovering the light sensor (light). Make notes in your README.md file and upload your program. Remember to use the .ino file extension.
+ Modify the program so that instead of blinking, the LED turns on when the light level is above some threshold (say 500), and turns off when the light level is below that threshold. Chose a threshold that is appropriate to the range of light levels that you get. You might want to refer to the if() statement tutorial. Make notes in your README.md file and upload your program. Remember to use the .ino file extension.
+ Modify the program so that the LED turns on when the light level is above some threshold (say 700), turns off when the light level is below a different threshold (say 300), and blinks if the light level is between those two thresholds. Again, choose appropriate thresholds. Make notes in your README.md file and upload your program. Remember to use the .ino file extension.
